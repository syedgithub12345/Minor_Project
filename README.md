OBJECTIVE

To design a recommendation system by :-
1.	To design a tree with multiple users with entry of each user but as input cannot be taken by any physical user we would use a random generating system which would mimic the physical user.
2.	Next we would search the common interest in the tree which we have created and find their similarity percentage. Then using backtracking recommend choices to one another.
